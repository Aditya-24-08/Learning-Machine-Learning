This folder contains the python implementation of the concept
of cross validation with an extreme example of leave one 
out. The model used is the threshold model and is quite naive.
These files are just for demonstrating this concept in practice.
Using cross validation, one can judge which model predicts
the data well out of a myriad of available models in machine
learning.
